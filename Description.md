Farmix allows users to utilize leverage when opening farm tokens on TON DEXs, thereby increasing user rewards by a multiple

In the TON ecosystem, liquidity providers and farmers enjoy high yield percentages ranging from 30 to 500% APY. ** With Farmix, liquidity providers can increase their yields by 2 to 2.5 times.**

The Farmix protocol operates as follows:

1. On one side, there are stakers - users who lend their tokens by staking them in Farmix pools.
2. Tokens with high liquidity can be staked on DEX: TON, USDT, NOT, SCALE, STON.
3. On the other side, the protocol involves farmers who take stakers' deposits with leverage up to 3x. Meanwhile, farmers place collateral in the form of TON, USDT, or other tokens available in the protocol.
4. To avoid the emergence of bad debt (when farmers cannot cover the debt on the deposits), an oracle intervenes to liquidate the farmer's position if the token price falls below the margin call.

Farmix protocol earns each time a farmer closes a position and takes a 40% protocol fee, which goes towards:

50% payment to liquidity providers
30% for buying back and burning the protocol token $FARM
12.5% to the protocol vault
7.5% to the team.
